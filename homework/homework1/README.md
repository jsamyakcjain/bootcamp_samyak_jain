# Project: Factor-Based Momentum and Reversal Strategy

This project aims to develop and backtest a quantitative trading strategy that capitalizes on two well-documented market anomalies: momentum and reversal. The strategy will use a factor-based approach to identify assets that are likely to continue their recent performance (momentum) and those that are due for a correction (reversal). The ultimate goal is to generate alpha by systematically taking long positions in "winner" factors and short positions in "loser" factors, while managing risk through diversification and dynamic rebalancing.

### Project Scope & Deliverables

#### Goal

The primary objective is to construct a factor-based momentum and reversal strategy and demonstrate its effectiveness through backtesting on historical data. This strategy will identify and trade on the persistence and mean-reversion of various market factors, rather than individual stocks. The expected outcome is a strategy that generates risk-adjusted returns superior to a simple market-cap-weighted index.

#### Stakeholders & Users

The key stakeholders are quantitative analysts and portfolio managers who are looking to enhance their existing portfolios with an alpha-generating strategy. They will use the project's output to understand how such a strategy works, its historical performance, and its potential for integration into a broader multi-strategy fund.

#### Useful Answer & Decision

The key artifact to deliver is a Python-based trading strategy that includes:

* Factor Construction Logic: A clear, documented process for defining and calculating various market factors (e.g., Value, Size, Momentum, Quality).

* Strategy Implementation: The core logic for ranking these factors and generating buy/sell signals based on momentum and reversal rules.

* Backtesting Engine: A comprehensive backtesting framework to simulate the strategy's performance over historical data.

* Performance Report: A detailed report with key metrics such as annualized returns, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and a comparison against a relevant benchmark.

### Assumptions & Constraints

* **Market Inefficiencies:** The strategy assumes that market prices do not instantly reflect all information, and that these behavioral biases lead to persistent trends (momentum) and overreactions (reversal) that can be exploited.

* **Data Availability:** The project relies on access to accurate and comprehensive historical market data, including factor returns and individual stock data.

* **Transaction Costs:** Backtesting will need to incorporate realistic transaction costs (commissions, slippage) to provide a more accurate representation of real-world performance.

* **Computational Resources:** The backtesting process may be computationally intensive, requiring sufficient processing power and memory.

### Risks & Mitigations

* **Known/Unknown Risks**:

  * Momentum Crashes: Sudden, unexpected market reversals that cause momentum strategies to underperform significantly.

  * Data Snooping: The risk of creating a model that works well only on historical data due to excessive optimization.

  * Factor Decay: The possibility that the factors used in the strategy lose their predictive power over time as more investors adopt similar strategies.

* **Mitigation Strategies**:

  * Implement a reversal overlay that quickly exits positions in a sharp downturn. Use risk management techniques like stop-losses and dynamic position sizing.

  * Use a separate out-of-sample data set for final validation. Be transparent about the parameter selection process and avoid over-optimizing.

  * Regularly review and refresh the factors used in the strategy. Explore new, non-traditional factors and incorporate a monitoring plan to track the profitability of each factor.
